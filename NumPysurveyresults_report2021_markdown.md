In the last year, 9% of NumPy users experienced problems in code they’ve written stemming from a problem in NumPy. What did they do about it? 76% found a workaround for it, 14% opened an issue in the NumPy repository on GitHub, and 6% proposed a change to NumPy by submitting a pull request.

#### In the last year, have you encountered a problem involving numerical data that you were unable to solve using NumPy?
![A bar chart that measures percentage of respondents by that encountered this problem. In descending order, the categories are No, Yes and N/A.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46167686/158427657-c480d60d-b3c7-41f8-aaf9-472d65e5bb3c.svg)

#### What action(s) did you take in response to this issue? Please select all that apply.
![A bar chart that measures percentage of answers by action taken to above mentioned problem. In descending order, the categories are Found a work-around, Switched to a different array library, Other, Stopped working on that particular code, Sought help on the mailing list and Opened an issue in the NumPy repo on Github.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46167686/158427667-894ef2f9-9691-4119-b592-b70572055822.svg)
During the same period of time, 18% of respondents encountered a problem involving numerical data that they were unable to solve using NumPy. Nearly 90% of respondents either found a workaround for it or switched to a different library, 3% sought help on the mailing list, and 2% opened an issue in the NumPy repository on GitHub.

#### NumPy encourages users to open issues. Please describe why you decided not to open an issue for your particular problem.
![A bar chart that measures percentage of respondents by reasons why they did not open an issue. In descending order, the categories are Found another solution, Not sure if it was an actual issue, Other and Not sure how.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46167686/158427694-19b6ffe3-e768-4fae-8cc7-43875a85602e.svg)
NumPy encourages users to open issues. Yet, last year, only 8% of respondents on average resorted to this option when they encountered a problem that might have been stemming from NumPy. One in ten admitted that they simply didn’t know how to file an issue with NumPy. 31% of respondents decided not to file an issue due to doubts that their problem was stemming from NumPy. The same percentage of users chose to use a workaround instead. 

### Deprecation Time Frame
#### NumPy normally has a two release cycle (1 year) deprecation policy. Do you think this is…
![A bar chart that measures percentage of respondents by answer. In descending order, the categories are Just right, Not sure, Too quick and Too slow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46167686/158427791-e1dde609-da44-4e61-99e4-cba8f594c896.svg)

#### What do you consider as a good deprecation time frame?
![A bar chart that measures percentage of respondents by answer. In descending order, the categories are Depends on the feature, 2 release cycles, Not sure, 3 release cucles, 1 release cycle (about 6 months) and Other.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46167686/158427801-74906bb9-7039-4f58-8754-80c6e8adbc06.svg)
The NumPy maintainers were eager to know what a good deprecation time frame was according to NumPy users. About one third of survey participants believes it should depend on the feature, while another third suggests for it to be 2 release cycles. Overall, the current NumPy deprecation policy of two release cycles (1 year) is supported by over 60% of respondents.

## Future Directions
### Project Priorities
#### If NumPy had one extra full-time developer, what would you like them to focus on? Please drag and drop the following items in order of priority with 1 being highest priority.
![A bar chart that measures percentage of respondents by highest priority. In descending order, the categories are Reliability, Performance, Documentation, New features, Packaging and Website redesign.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46167686/158427824-316785a5-8b73-4078-ab6a-dbdc76bfca31.svg)
Once again NumPy users put performance and reliability at the top of the priority list for the project. 

#### Performance
The overall sentiment in the comments is that NumPy performance is already good, but further improvements are possible and should be put high on the project’s priority list.
Parallel execution, GPU support, and improved interoperability with other packages, both via the NumPy array protocols and directly with CuPy, Dask, JAX, Numba, Cython, Pythran, PyPy, and deep learning frameworks were mentioned most often. Also, quite a few respondents suggested making better use of modern hardware capabilities like SIMD instructions and simplifying the back-end switches for, in particular, BLAS.

#### Reliability
NumPy users are almost unanimous that NumPy is very reliable already and it’s essential that it remains this way, including while introducing new features and if the speed of development were to increase in the future. Minor points identified for improvement include the clarity of error messages and dealing with inconsistencies and quirks in the parts of NumPy that are used less often.

### The Big Picture
#### A few final questions for any additional thoughts/opinions about NumPy that you’d like to share. What single immediate change to NumPy would bring the most value to you as a NumPy user?
- Support more modern Fortran features in f2py.
- I would like to see events where we call open source researchers to implement their papers to numpy core, like a competition who has the fastest fft. 
- I've really appreciated the renewed willingness of the numpy development community to accept larger changes. Kudos.
- -Integration/consolidation of NumPy/Numba/CuPy/Xarray into a single framework for JIT compiling for CPU and GPU.
- Documentation with more examples to better understand the context in which to use certain functionality. (The comment was submitted in Spanish.)
- Translations of documentation to reach more people. (The comment was submitted in Spanish.)
- A numpy discourse to help when asking questions.
- Better build system, also some documentation on how to use it (especially for building FORTRAN extensions).

In an open-ended question, we asked: "What single immediate change to NumPy would bring the most value to you as a NumPy user?” Just like in 2020, there was no lack of creative ideas and opinions on solving current pain points in NumPy and downstream, from introducing a unified array API to OpenBLAS optimization and better support for typing. However, documentation received by far the most attention.

#### Documentation
The majority of respondents are happy with the quality of the NumPy documentation. Still, a number of suggestions were submitted for further improvement. "Examples, more examples, and more detailed examples" is the recurrent theme in about half the comments. Translations of the documentation and educational materials into other languages are also high on NumPy users' wish lists. A common concern about the NumPy documentation is that NumPy is very large, and it's often not easy to navigate the documentation and find the functionality that best fits a user's need.

### Other Significant Changes
#### What other significant changes would you like to see in NumPy?
When asked about what other significant changes our users would like to see in NumPy, GPU support and improved F2PY were mentioned as often as documentation.

#### GPU support

#### F2PY
A few survey participants have expressed interest in the inclusion of modern Fortran features to F2PY, as well as improved documentation including usage examples. In particular, respondents mentioned derived types support, which is currently being implemented, and some maintenance improvements that would make contributing to the codebase easier. The spontaneous mentions to F2PY in the survey show that many projects rely on it for efficient interoperability between C/Fortran and Python.

#### Documentation
The comments about the NumPy documentation in response to this question largely overlap with the responses about a single immediate change for NumPy (refer to the summary regarding the documentation in the section above).

### Closing Questions
#### Please tell us how you heard about this survey.
![A bar chart that measures percentage of respondents by how they heard about this survey. In descending order, the categories are Social media platform (Twitter, Facebook...), NumPy.org homepage, Other, Forwarded link from a friend, NumPy mailing list, SciPy conference.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46167686/158427842-3f8c83ca-d261-4d86-968d-4ca0fc6adf65.svg)
Nearly half of respondents heard about the survey on Twitter, and one in four found out about it through the announcement on the numpy.org home page.

#### Did you respond to last year's NumPy Community Survey (2020)?

Only 13% of the 2021 respondents participated in the previous year’s survey.

## Methodology
Over 500 NumPy users from 54 countries participated in this online survey, which was fielded from July 8th to September 6th, 2021. Respondents were recruited via the NumPy mailing list, the NumPy Slack channel, the banner display on the numpy.org homepage, the NumFOCUS newsletter, announcements at the SciPy’21 conference, and via Twitter.

To engage non-English speaking stakeholders, we conducted the survey in 8 additional languages: Bangla, French, Hindi, Japanese, Mandarin, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish.

The 2021 user survey questionnaire was largely adapted from the 2020 version. Some totals don’t equal 100% due to multiple-choice answers or rounding.
